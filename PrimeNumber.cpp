/*Brute Force Method - O(n) Time

In this approach, we can check whether the number is prime or not by iterating in 
the range from 1 to n. If there are more than 2 divisor (including 1 and n) then the given number n 
is not prime, else n is prime. This method is known as trial division method.

Optimized Method - O(âˆšn) Time

In this approach, we don't check all divisors of the given number, we only check divisors up 
to the square root of the number.*/
